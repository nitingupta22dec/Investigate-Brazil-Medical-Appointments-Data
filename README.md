# Investigate-Brazil-Medical-Appointments-Data
The dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

I have performed the complete data analysis process on this dataset. The process includes the following phases: 
- Question Phase
- Wrangling Phase
- Exploration Phase
- Drawing Conclusions Phase
- Communication Phase

Libraries that I've used in the Data Analysis Process:
